# cbindgen generates the C-header file (`.h` file) for the Rust functions
# exported with `extern "C"`, that we will use in Go.
# It also exports the data types annotated with `#[repr(C)]`.
#
# The header file is platform independent (same for all platforms), and it is
# included along the `libgomlx_tokenizers.tar.gz` artifact, since the version
# of the `.h` file and the library `libgomlx_tokenizers.a` must match.
